# Template CMake Project
This project is my base for every CMake based project.

## The most important components
1. Batch scripts handling building, opening, and cleaning the solution.
2. File `cmake/CMakeShared.cmake` with default defined configurations and compilation flags setup, as well as general utility functions(e.g. get_all_files_of_file_type, get_source_files, get_header_files etc.)
